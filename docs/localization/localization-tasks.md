# Signi concept definitions — localization catalogue

A work brief. Every concept in the corpus should show a **localized definition** in the picker
tooltip — composed by the grammar engine from seeded concepts and rendered into all seven
languages, the same way the payoff tagline is (`ConceptSeed.definition`, a `PhrasePlan`; see
[../../packages/backend/src/definitions.ts](../../packages/backend/src/definitions.ts) and
[../../packages/backend/src/concepts/nouns.ts](../../packages/backend/src/concepts/nouns.ts)).

This catalogue splits that work one-task-per-file, classified by **feasibility**, and is driven by
the [`/localize-seed`](../../.claude/skills/localize-seed/SKILL.md) skill (one id at a time), exactly
as [`docs/bugs/`](../bugs/engine-grammar-bugs.md) is driven by `/fix-bug`.

The tasks live under three subdirectories:

- **[`A-ready/`](A-ready/)** — **do now.** Composable today from already-seeded concepts using an
  existing plan shape. `/localize-seed` authors these directly.
- **[`B-needs-seed/`](B-needs-seed/)** — **do after seeding words.** The plan shape works, but a
  concept it references isn't seeded yet. Each file's **Seed first** section lists the missing words
  (with proposed forms). Seed them (the [`seed`](../../.claude/skills/seed/SKILL.md) skill), then the
  task becomes an A.
- **[`C-needs-engine/`](C-needs-engine/)** — **blocked / deferred.** Needs a grammatical construct the
  engine can't render yet (its **Blocked on** section names it), or is deliberately left on the
  English literal because no distinguishing definition can be composed.

Fixed tasks move to [`done/`](done/) and are listed in the **Done** section below.

## How the tasks are encoded

- A concept's definition is a `PhrasePlan` set as its `definition` in the seed. Two shapes exist:
  - **genus + differentia** — `glossOf(genus, ...adjectives)` → "a small mammal".
  - **genus + relative clause** — `whoGloss(genus, verb, objectConcept?)` → "a person who makes
    objects" (the head fills the clause's subject gap; the object renders bare-plural).
- The renderer [`buildConceptDefinitions()`](../../packages/backend/src/definitions.ts) renders every
  plan into all 7 languages **at backend startup and throws if any language is missing** — so a task
  is "done" only when it boots clean. That boot check is the catalogue's pinning test.
- Classification follows feasibility, not the concept's role: an A references only seeded concepts; a
  B names unseeded words; a C names a missing construct.

## Index

### Part A — Ready (`A-ready/`)

_None outstanding — every catalogued A-task is done (see the Done section). New A-tasks land here._

### Part B — Needs seeding (`B-needs-seed/`)

_None outstanding — every catalogued B-task is done (see the Done section). New B-tasks land here._

### Part C — Needs engine / deferred (`C-needs-engine/`)

|---|---|---|
| C01 | [C01-verb-definitions.md](C-needs-engine/C01-verb-definitions.md) | render mode **landed** (infinitive citation) — EAT/DRINK done; 46 remaining now gated on seeding each verb's genus |
